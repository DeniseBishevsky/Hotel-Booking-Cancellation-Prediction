Intro:
This project is the final project in the "Introduction to Machine Learning" course at the Faculty of Engineering,
as a part of the BS.c degree 'Sciences for High-Tech' in Tel Aviv University.
In this project we received a large data set file containing various features on bookings made in hotels and labels whether the booking was canceled or not.
The aim of the project is to predict using machine learning models whether a particular order may be canceled or not.
